Internal Risks
Absence of Team Members
Mitigation: Backup roles and cross-training ensure coverage for absent team members. This reduces the likelihood of delays.

Insufficient Communication
Mitigation: Daily stand-up meetings enhance project transparency and coordination, significantly reducing communication issues.

Tasks Not Completed on Time
Mitigation: Improved project management through tools like WhatsApp enhances task coordination and accountability.

Lack of Experience/Knowledge
Mitigation: Training and mentoring enhance skills, reducing the impact of inexperience on project progress.

Unrealistic Scheduling
Mitigation: Setting realistic timelines with buffer periods for delays ensures more accurate scheduling and less stress.

Technical Challenges in Software/Hardware Integration
Mitigation: Thorough testing and early prototyping identify and resolve integration issues early on.

External Risks
Changing Requirements from Stakeholders
Mitigation: Regular stakeholder engagement helps align project goals with current requirements, preventing scope creep.

Hardware Limitations
Mitigation: Evaluating alternative hardware solutions ensures that system requirements are met without compromising performance.
