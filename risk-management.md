__Internal Risks__
<br>
Absence of Team Members<br>
Mitigation: Backup roles and cross-training ensure coverage for absent team members. This reduces the likelihood of delays.<br>

Insufficient Communication<br>
Mitigation: Daily stand-up meetings enhance project transparency and coordination, significantly reducing communication issues.<br>

Tasks Not Completed on Time<br>
Mitigation: Improved project management through tools like WhatsApp enhances task coordination and accountability.<br>

Lack of Experience/Knowledge<br>
Mitigation: Training and mentoring enhance skills, reducing the impact of inexperience on project progress.<br>

Unrealistic Scheduling<br>
Mitigation: Setting realistic timelines with buffer periods for delays ensures more accurate scheduling and less stress.<br>

Technical Challenges in Software/Hardware Integration<br>
Mitigation: Thorough testing and early prototyping identify and resolve integration issues early on.<br>



__External Risks__
<br>
Changing Requirements from Stakeholders <br>
Mitigation: Regular stakeholder engagement helps align project goals with current requirements, preventing scope creep. <br> 

Hardware Limitations <br>
Mitigation: Evaluating alternative hardware solutions ensures that system requirements are met without compromising performance.<br>
