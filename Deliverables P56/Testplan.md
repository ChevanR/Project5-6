# Test Plan: VR and Haptic Integration in an Extended Reality Environment  

---

## Introduction  
The purpose of this test plan is to systematically validate the requirements outlined in the product backlog for the **VR and Haptic Cloud Integration** project. Each test ensures that critical functionalitiesâ€”including VR application development, remote rendering, network degradation simulation, and haptic feedbackâ€”are implemented correctly and meet the defined acceptance criteria.  

This document provides a structured approach to testing, with requirements categorized by priority and marked **done** upon successful verification.

## Test Plan  

### Test 1: VR Application and Remote Rendering Verification  
**Purpose**  
Validate that the VR application renders correctly on a remote server, and the VR headset updates in real time.  

**Requirements Verified**  
- **1**: VR Application Development  
- **2**: Use an actual VR headset for the application  
- **3**: Remote Rendering Implementation  

**Steps**  
1. Launch the Unity VR test environment.  
2. Connect the Oculus Quest 3 headset using ALVR.  
3. Initiate a remote-rendering session.  
4. Move the VR headset and confirm corresponding camera movements in Unity.  
5. Disconnect the headset and ensure the application continues rendering at a stable frame rate (e.g., 60 FPS).  

**Results**  
âœ… The VR application rendered correctly, camera movements synced, and rendering continued seamlessly after headset disconnection.

### Test 2: Network Degradation and Performance Data Logging  
**Purpose**  
Evaluate VR performance under simulated latency and verify that performance metrics are logged accurately.  

**Requirements Verified**  
- **4**: Network Degradation Simulation  
- **5**: Performance Data Logging  
- **6**: Data Analysis  

**Steps**  
1. Connect the Oculus Quest 3 headset to the Unity test environment.  
2. Use **Clumsy** to simulate network latency at 50ms, 100ms, 150ms, and 200ms.  
3. Perform basic VR movements and observe frame rate and input lag.  
4. Log performance metrics (frame rates, input delay) to a JSON file.  
5. Analyze and graph the results to identify trends between latency and VR performance.  

**Results**  
âœ… Network degradation caused expected performance drops, and JSON logs captured latency, frame rates, and input delays. Graphs highlighted the correlation.

**Requirements Verified**  
- **17**: Client needs to go between 1st and 3rd person  
- **18**: 1st and 3rd person needs to be done with gestures  

**Steps**  
1. Implement manual switching between first-person and third-person camera views.  
2. Configure gestures using the Ultraleap Haptic Device to trigger the camera switch.  
3. Test both manual and gesture-based switches for responsiveness and accuracy.  

**Results**  
âœ… Switching between first-person and third-person views worked accurately, and gesture-based commands performed reliably with minimal latency.

### Test 6: VR and Haptic User Experience Under Latency  
**Purpose**  
Assess the combined impact of latency on user experience with VR visuals and haptic feedback.  

**Requirements Verified**  
- **20**: Haptic & VR user experience  

**Steps**  
1. Connect the VR headset and Ultraleap Haptic Device.  
2. Introduce simulated latency increments of 50ms, 100ms, and 200ms using **Clumsy**.  
3. Have **3â€“5 participants** interact with the VR environment and haptic feedback simultaneously.  
4. Collect user feedback on usability, motion sickness, and task performance.  

**Results**  
âœ… Combined latency significantly affected user experience beyond 100ms. Feedback confirmed reduced usability at 200ms latency.

## Summary and Conclusion  

### Summary  
The test plan verified all **Must Have** requirements and addressed several **Should/Could** items. Each test was systematically executed, capturing performance data and user feedback for analysis.  

### Conclusion  
- **Must Have Requirements**: âœ… Fully validated.  
- **Should/Could Requirements**: ðŸŸ¡ Partially completed, pending refinements.  
- **Haptic and VR Experience**: Combined tests demonstrated expected latency limitations, confirming thresholds for usability.
