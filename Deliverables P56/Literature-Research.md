## Literature Review: Haptic Interface in an Extended Reality Environment

### Introduction
This review explores two emerging areas in the realm of extended reality (XR): the use of ultrasonic arrays for haptic feedback and the streaming of virtual reality (VR) experiences via cloud systems. While these technologies are established in their respective fields, their integration into XR presents unique challenges and opportunities that are yet to be fully explored.

### Research Questions
This study addresses two central questions:
1. **How can ultrasonic array technology enhance haptic feedback in extended reality environments?**
2. **What are the main challenges in streaming VR simulations over cloud networks, and how can these be overcome to ensure smooth delivery to remote VR headsets?**

### Methodology
#### Step 1: Subproblems Identification
- **Ultrasonic Arrays for Haptics**: Focuses on how ultrasonic technology can create unique tactile sensations in VR, a concept with significant potential yet limited application in real-world XR settings.
- **Cloud VR Streaming**: Concentrates on the efficiency of streaming VR content via cloud systems, highlighting the technical hurdles like network variability, latency, and user experience.

#### Step 2: Defining Search Terms
Identified key terms for an in-depth exploration include:
- For **Ultrasonic Arrays**: "ultrasonic array AND haptic feedback", "innovations in haptic technology", "haptic feedback using ultrasonic waves."
- For **Cloud-based VR**: "virtual reality cloud rendering", "streaming VR content", "network requirements for cloud VR", "user experience in cloud-based VR."

#### Step 3: Crafting Search Strings
The search strings formulated to guide the literature search were:
- **Ultrasonic Haptic Feedback**: "integration of ultrasonic arrays AND extended reality", "use of ultrasonic waves in virtual environments."
- **Cloud VR Systems**: "challenges in cloud-based VR streaming", "optimizing VR simulation for cloud delivery", "impact of network variability on VR performance."

#### Step 4: Performing the Search
The literature search involved databases such as Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, and industry reports to compile a comprehensive set of peer-reviewed articles, technical reports, and whitepapers.

### Findings
#### Ultrasonic Haptic Feedback
Research indicates that ultrasonic arrays, traditionally utilized in medical and industrial settings, are promising for consumer VR applications due to their precision in generating tactile feedback. Their application in consumer XR, however, remains scant, presenting a prime opportunity for groundbreaking developments.

#### Cloud-based VR
While theoretical models of cloud VR infrastructure are extensively documented, real-time VR streaming under variable network conditions has seen limited practical application. This gap is pivotal for future advancements, necessitating close collaboration between network engineers and VR developers.

### Conclusion
This review underscores the potential for pioneering research in ultrasonic haptic feedback and cloud-based VR. Addressing the identified gaps, especially in practical implementations and technological enhancements, could revolutionize both fields.

### Future Work
- **Experimental Prototyping**: Plans to build and test prototypes that integrate ultrasonic feedback in VR systems to validate theoretical concepts.
- **Cloud Streaming Optimization**: Aims to develop and refine cloud streaming techniques to minimize latency and enhance the user experience in real-time VR, leveraging insights from network engineering.
