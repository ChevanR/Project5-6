# Test Report: VR and Haptic Integration in an Extended Reality Environment 

The **Test Report** documents the results and observations of each test from the [Test Plan](Testplan.md).

## Test 1: VR Application and Remote Rendering Verification  
**Results**  
âœ… The VR application rendered correctly, camera movements synced, and rendering continued seamlessly after headset disconnection.  

---

## Test 2: Network Degradation and Performance Data Logging  
**Results**  
âœ… Network degradation caused expected performance drops, and JSON logs captured latency, frame rates, and input delays. Graphs highlighted the correlation.  

---

## Test 3: Multiplayer and Client Identification  
**Results**  
âœ… Multiplayer functionality worked seamlessly, and identification features (Colors) displayed correctly.  

---

## Test 4: Haptic Feedback and Gesture-Based Map Controls  
**Results**  
âœ… Haptic feedback worked as intended, with varied tactile responses based on terrain. Gesture controls effectively manipulated the map.  

---

## Test 5: Switching Between 1st and 3rd Person (With Gestures)  
**Results**  
âœ… Switching between first-person and third-person views worked accurately, and gesture-based commands performed reliably with minimal latency.  

---

## Test 6: VR and Haptic User Experience Under Latency  
**Results**  
âœ… Combined latency significantly affected user experience beyond 100ms. Feedback confirmed reduced usability at 200ms latency.

# Summary and Conclusion  

## Summary  
The **Test Plan** verified all **Must Have** requirements and addressed several **Should/Could** items. Each test was systematically executed, capturing performance data and user feedback for analysis.  

## Conclusion  
- **Must Have Requirements**: âœ… Fully validated.  
- **Should/Could Requirements**: ðŸŸ¡ Partially completed, pending refinements.  
- **Haptic and VR Experience**: Combined tests demonstrated expected latency limitations, confirming thresholds for usability.  

The project is on schedule, with critical features validated and user feedback incorporated. Future efforts will focus on refining haptic integration and optimizing network performance.
