## Findings

### Ultrasonic Haptic Feedback
Research reveals that **ultrasonic arrays** have significant potential in XR applications:
- **Precise Tactile Feedback:** Ultrasonic waves can simulate diverse textures and forces without physical contact.
- **Intensity Modulation:** Arrays allow dynamic adjustment of feedback intensity, critical for immersive XR environments.

However, gaps remain in meeting key requirements for practical adoption:
- **Latency Tolerance:** Synchronizing tactile feedback with visual and auditory elements under real-time constraints.
- **User Perception:** Ensuring consistent and realistic haptic sensations across various user interactions.
- **Hardware Integration:** Adapting ultrasonic arrays for compact, cost-effective XR devices.

### Cloud-based VR
The feasibility of **cloud VR streaming** is heavily dependent on meeting strict performance requirements:
1. **Latency:** Studies suggest a maximum end-to-end latency of 20 milliseconds for seamless interaction. Higher latency degrades immersion and usability.
2. **Bandwidth:** Minimum requirements vary based on resolution and frame rate; typical recommendations range from 50 to 100 Mbps for 4K VR.
3. **Adaptive Algorithms:** Real-time adjustments to frame rate and resolution are crucial to mitigating network variability.

Proposed solutions include:
- **Predictive Rendering:** Techniques that anticipate user movements to reduce perceived latency.
- **Edge Computing:** Placing computation closer to end-users to decrease data transmission delays.

However, practical validations under real-world conditions remain scarce. Particularly, the integration of haptic feedback into cloud VR systems introduces additional complexity.
