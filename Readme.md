# How to use
- Start the ALVR streamer and connect with the VR headset
- Run the "alvr-socket.py" script and let it generate a log file, whilst running the session
- Close the script with using CRTL+C twice, when you are done with the VR session
  
Now there will be a a folder named alvr-logs made with a json file inside with the statistics logs of that previous session.

It contains the following two entries:

To graph this data, run the "json-to-graph.py" script fill in the file location and see the newly created .html file which contains the graphs, <b>be sure to give it another name before graphing a new json logging file, as it will overwrite it.</b>
