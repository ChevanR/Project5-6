# How to use
- Start the ALVR streamer and connect with the VR headset
- Run the "alvr-socket.py" script and let it generate a log file, whilst running the session
- Close the script with using CRTL+C twice, when you are done with the VR session
  
Now there will be a a folder named alvr-logs made with a json file inside with the statistics logs of that previous session.

It contains the following two entries:

###### Value explanation


- **total_pipeline_latency_s**: Total latency in seconds from the time a frame is generated to when it is displayed on the VR headset.
  - **game_time_s**: Time taken by the game engine to generate a frame.
  - **server_compositor_s**: Time taken by the server's compositor to process and prepare the graphics for encoding.
  - **encoder_s**: Time taken by the server encoder to compress the frame for network transmission.
  - **network_s**: Network latency, representing the time taken for the encoded frame data to be sent from the server to the client (VR headset).
  - **decoder_s**: Time taken by the client to decode the incoming compressed frame data.
  - **decoder_queue_s**: Time spent queuing the decoded frame before it is rendered. Longer queue times can indicate buffering delays.
  - **client_compositor_s**: Time spent by the client compositor to integrate the decoded frame with any overlays or UI elements before display.
  - **vsync_queue_s**: Time spent waiting for the VR headset’s display to be ready for the next frame.
- **client_fps**: Frame rate at which the VR content is displayed on the client (headset).
- **server_fps**: Frame rate at which frames are generated by the server.
- **requested_bps**: The bitrate that the system requests which is here set to 30 mbps.
- **actual_bitrate_bps**: The actual bitrate achieved during data transmission, unsure is bps or kbps, we can assume it is kbps, because 39 kbps is very low, for VR streaming.

###### Value explanation
- **video_packets_total**: The total number of video packets sent so far. Here, 84,666 packets have been sent.
- **video_packets_per_sec**: The current rate of video packets sent per second, measured as 60 packets per second in this data.
- **video_mbytes_total**: The total amount of video data sent, measured in megabytes.
- **video_mbits_per_sec**: The transmission rate of video data in megabits per second.
- **packets_lost_total**: Total number of packets lost during transmission. 0 indicating no packet loss.
- **packets_lost_per_sec**: Number of packets lost per second.
- **battery_hmd**: Current battery level of the VR headset (HMD).
- **hmd_plugged**: Indicates whether the headset is plugged in (`true`) or running on battery (`false`). Here, it is `true`, meaning it is plugged in.

The other values which look the same as for the Statistics data, are the averages of those values.


To graph this data, run the "json-to-graph.py" script fill in the file location and see the newly created .html file which contains the graphs, <b>be sure to give it another name before graphing a new json logging file, as it will overwrite it.</b>


## User experience testing
- Start the testworld
- Explain to the user how the test works
- Start the test using the clumsy tool

#### Clumsy
Clumsy is a network tool where you can introduce artificial degredation, which is used to gather the user experience in situations where the network connection isn't always the best.

To download clumsy follow the link below.

##### Use guide
- Select the preset "udp ipv4 against specific ip"
- Enter the client IP found in alvr fill in the "ip.DstAddr" and "ip.SrcAddr" with this ip
- Press start and introduce the needed degredation
