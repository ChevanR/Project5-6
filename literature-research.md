## Literature Review: Haptic Interface in an Extended Reality Environment

### Introduction
This review explores two emerging areas: using ultrasonic arrays for haptic feedback and streaming virtual reality (VR) experiences via cloud systems. These fields are still not established in research and development, presenting unique challenges and opportunities. The goal is to gather existing research, pinpoint the gaps, and chart a path for future experiments.

### Research Questions
This study is centered on two key questions:
1. **How can ultrasonic array technology enhance haptic feedback in extended reality environments?**
2. **What are the main challenges in streaming VR simulations over cloud networks, and how can these be overcome to ensure smooth delivery to remote VR headsets?**

### Methodology
#### Step 1: Subproblems Identification
- **Ultrasonic Arrays for Haptics**: Investigating how ultrasonic technology can create unique tactile sensations in virtual environments—a concept with significant potential yet limited real-world applications.
- **Cloud VR Streaming**: Examining how VR content can be streamed efficiently via the cloud, addressing technical challenges such as network variability, latency, and user experience.

#### Step 2: Defining Search Terms
Key terms identified for in-depth exploration include:
- For **Ultrasonic Arrays**: "ultrasonic array AND haptic feedback", "innovations in haptic technology", "haptic feedback using ultrasonic waves"
- For **Cloud-based VR**: "virtual reality cloud rendering", "streaming VR content", "network requirements for cloud VR", "user experience in cloud-based VR"

#### Step 3: Crafting Search Strings
To streamline the literature search, the following search strings were created:
- **Ultrasonic Haptic Feedback**: "integration of ultrasonic arrays AND extended reality", "use of ultrasonic waves in virtual environments"
- **Cloud VR Systems**: "challenges in cloud-based VR streaming", "optimizing VR simulation for cloud delivery", "impact of network variability on VR performance"

#### Step 4: Performing the Search
Research was conducted using databases such as Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, and industry reports to gather a comprehensive set of peer-reviewed articles, technical reports, and whitepapers.

### Findings
#### Ultrasonic Haptic Feedback
Research suggests that ultrasonic arrays, traditionally used in medical and industrial settings, hold promise for consumer VR applications due to their ability to generate precise haptic feedback. However, their application in VR for consumer markets remains underexplored, presenting a clear opportunity for innovative work.

#### Cloud-based VR
While theoretical models on cloud VR infrastructure are well-documented, practical implementations for real-time VR streaming—especially under varying network conditions—are scarce. This gap is critical for future development, with network engineers and VR developers needing to collaborate closely to overcome these hurdles.

### Conclusion
This review highlights the potential to contribute groundbreaking research in two key areas: ultrasonic haptic feedback and cloud-based VR. Addressing the gaps identified, particularly in practical implementations and technical optimizations, will significantly advance both technological understanding and practical applications.

### Future Work
- **Experimental Prototyping**: Build and test prototypes that integrate ultrasonic feedback into VR systems to validate theoretical findings.
- **Cloud Streaming Optimization**: Develop and test cloud streaming methods to minimize latency and improve user experience for real-time VR, incorporating insights from network engineering.
