## OriÃ«ntation
**Problem part 1:**
There is a ultrasonic array which is used for haptic purposes, the problem is that this device is bleeding edge technology, thus there hasn't been much research about it. Making the project be about doing experimentation research using this device.

**Problem part 2:**
VR in a cloud like environment, also not a lot of research about it.
What the product owners want is a simulated network environment where the VR simulation is remotely rendered and streamed to the VR headset.
