## Literature Review: Haptic Interface in an Extended Reality Environment

### Introduction
This review explores the innovative integration of ultrasonic arrays for haptic feedback and the execution of virtual reality (VR) simulations through cloud-based systems. Both technologies are not big in terms of research and development, presenting unique challenges and opportunities. The goal is to collect and document existing data, pinpoint research gaps, and define a clear experimental direction for our project.

### Research questions
Our study is guided by two main questions:
1. **How can ultrasonic array technology be effectively integrated for haptic feedback in extended reality settings?**
2. **What challenges do we face with VR simulations over cloud networks, and how can these be effectively streamed to VR headsets remotely?**

### Step 1: Subproblems identification
- **Ultrasonic Array for Haptic Feedback**: Ultrasonic technology promises new methods for generating tactile feedback in virtual environments, yet its practical applications remain largely unexplored.
- **VR in Cloud Environments**: As cloud gaming and simulations gain traction, adapting these for VR could transform accessibility and scalability. However, detailed research on optimizing such systems for real-time user interactions and varied network conditions is scarce.

### Step 2: Search Terms
Identified search terms for a thorough exploration:
- For **Ultrasonic Haptic Arrays**: "ultrasonic array AND haptic feedback", "innovations in haptic technology", "haptic feedback using ultrasonic waves"
- For **Cloud-based VR**: "virtual reality cloud rendering", "streaming VR content", "network requirements for cloud VR", "user experience in cloud-based VR"

### Step 3: Creating Search strings
Combining search terms into comprehensive queries:
- For **Ultrasonic Haptic Feedback**: "integration of ultrasonic arrays AND extended reality", "use of ultrasonic waves in virtual environments"
- For **Cloud VR Systems**: "challenges in cloud-based VR streaming", "optimizing VR simulation for cloud delivery", "impact of network variability on VR performance"

### Step 4: Performing the search
Utilizing databases such as Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, and relevant industry reports to gather extensive data including peer-reviewed articles, technical reports, and whitepapers.

### Step 5: Analyzing the findings
- **Ultrasonic Haptic Feedback**: The initial search indicates an emerging field ripe for practical research contributions.
- **Cloud-based VR**: Preliminary research shows substantial theoretical development but a lack of applied research, particularly in live VR streaming optimization for varying network conditions.

### Conclusion
This literature review highlights the pioneering aspects of our project, identifying significant opportunities to impact the fields of ultrasonic haptic feedback and cloud-based VR. By recognizing existing research gaps, our project is strategically positioned to focus experimental efforts on these areas, enhancing both the technological understanding and practical implementations.
