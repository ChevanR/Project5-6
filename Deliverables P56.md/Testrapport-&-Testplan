## Test Plan  

### Test 1: VR Application and Remote Rendering Verification  
**Purpose**  
Validate that the VR application renders correctly on a remote server, and the VR headset updates in real time.  

**Requirements Verified**  
- **1**: VR Application Development  
- **2**: Use an actual VR headset for the application  
- **3**: Remote Rendering Implementation  

**Steps**  
1. Launch the Unity VR test environment.  
2. Connect the Oculus Quest 3 headset using ALVR.  
3. Initiate a remote-rendering session.  
4. Move the VR headset and confirm corresponding camera movements in Unity.  
5. Disconnect the headset and ensure the application continues rendering at a stable frame rate (e.g., 60 FPS).

### Test 2: Network Degradation and Performance Data Logging  
**Purpose**  
Evaluate VR performance under simulated latency and verify that performance metrics are logged accurately.  

**Requirements Verified**

- **5**: Performance Data Logging  
- **6**: Data Analysis  

**Steps**  
1. Connect the Oculus Quest 3 headset to the Unity test environment.  
2. Use **Clumsy** to simulate network latency at 50ms, 100ms, 150ms, and 200ms.  
3. Perform basic VR movements and observe frame rate and input lag.  
4. Log performance metrics (frame rates, input delay) to a JSON file.  
5. Analyze and graph the results to identify trends between latency and VR performance.

### Test 6: VR and Haptic User Experience Under Latency  
**Results**  
âœ… Combined latency significantly affected user experience beyond 100ms. Feedback confirmed reduced usability at 200ms latency.

## Summary and Conclusion  

### Summary  
The **Test Plan** verified all **Must Have** requirements and addressed several **Should/Could** items. Each test was systematically executed, capturing performance data and user feedback for analysis.  

### Conclusion  
- **Must Have Requirements**: âœ… Fully validated.  
- **Should/Could Requirements**: ðŸŸ¡ Partially completed, pending refinements.  
- **Haptic and VR Experience**: Combined tests demonstrated expected latency limitations, confirming thresholds for usability.  

The project is on schedule, with critical features validated and user feedback incorporated. Future efforts will focus on refining haptic integration and optimizing network performance.
