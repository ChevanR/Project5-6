## Project Overview
This repository contains the development, testing, and documentation for the **VR and Haptic Cloud Integration** project. The goal of this project is to combine **Virtual Reality (VR)** streaming with **haptic feedback** to create an immersive and interactive extended reality (XR) experience. We focus on:

1. **VR Streaming**: Remote rendering of VR environments using cloud servers.
2. **Haptic Feedback**: Integration of tactile sensations using Ultraleap haptic devices.
3. **Latency Management**: Simulating and analyzing network degradation to measure performance.
4. **User Experience**: Ensuring usability under varying latency conditions.

## Purpose of the Repository
This GitHub repository serves as the central hub for the project's:
- **Source Code**: Unity projects, VR environment setup, and haptic feedback integration.
- **Documentation**: Detailed project plans, reports, and findings, including:
   - Test Plans
   - Experimental Results
   - Risk Management
   - Research Analysis
- **Changelogs**: Tracking development progress and updates.
- **Data and Logs**: Performance metrics and user testing data.
- Review the **Test Plan** and **Test Report** documents for insights into testing procedures and results.

## Key Features
- **Remote VR Streaming**: Low-latency VR streaming using cloud-based rendering.
- **Haptic Integration**: Ultraleap-powered tactile feedback to enhance immersion.
- **Latency Testing**: Tools to simulate network degradation and evaluate system performance.
- **User Testing**: Feedback-driven improvements to usability and interactivity.
