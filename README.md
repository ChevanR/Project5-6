# Vr and haptic cloud integration project

This project aims to revolutionize remote vr experiences by integrating cutting-edge haptic feedback through cloud technology, providing users with a truly immersive xr environment.

Refer to [research report](Deliverables-P56/Research-Report.md) for detailed experimental methodologies and findings.  
Refer to [usage guide](Deliverables-P56/Usage-guide.md) for comprehensive setup and operating instructions.

## Project overview
This repository contains all the source code, documentation, and testing frameworks for the vr and haptic cloud integration project. Our objective is to merge vr streaming with haptic feedback to deliver an interactive extended reality (xr) experience. Key aspects include:
1. **VR streaming**: Remote rendering of vr environments utilizing cloud servers.
2. **Haptic feedback**: Integration of tactile sensations via ultraleap devices.
3. **Latency management**: Simulation and analysis of network degradation.
4. **User experience**: Optimizing usability under variable latency conditions.

## Purpose of the repository
This github repository is the central hub for:
- **Source code**: Unity projects and haptic feedback integration.
- **Documentation**: Project plans, test plans, experimental results, risk management strategies, and research analysis.
- **Changelogs**: Detailed records of development progress and updates.
- **Data and logs**: Performance metrics and user testing data.

For setup instructions, please refer to the [usage guide](Deliverables-P56/Usage-guide.md).

## Key features
- **Remote vr streaming**: Enables low-latency streaming through cloud-based rendering.
- **Haptic integration**: Delivers tactile feedback powered by ultraleap devices for enhanced immersion.
